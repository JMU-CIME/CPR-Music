            Teachers who provide their students with a standards-based music
            education facilitate opportunities for every student to develop
            skill and knowledge related to creating original music, performing
            their own and others’ music, responding to music, and connecting in,
            around, and through music. While MusicCPR is framed through these
            four artistic processes as conceptualized in National Standards for
            Arts Education, most states have comparable policy documents that
            outline what should be part of students’ P-12 music education
            experiences. MusicCPR is intended to bridge the gap between these
            policies and common practice by providing a free, research-based
            resource for any music teacher who wishes to provide their students
            opportunities to create, perform, respond, and connect through
            activities grounded in large ensemble repertoire.
